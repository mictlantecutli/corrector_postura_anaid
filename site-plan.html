      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I work with  health and natural products. I sell natural supplements and girdles.
Also manage different kinds of girdles; for modeling, post quirurgic and for the posture.
Did you know that the mobile, the job, the stress are causing pains in your neck and back thus in a wrong posture?
For that I work a girdle posture corrector, 
have you heard that even with one girdle of posture the people continue with back pains and bad posture?
With the corrector posture girdle I give free an exercise system to relieve the problems in the back or neck. So The corrector posture and the exercise guide for posture really help you to better the bad posture and back pains.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>They are people that frequently look for massage, sports accessories. They practice yoga, pilates routines. They have an office job, most of the time they are sitting in front of a computer and do not have enough time to do exercise. They work at least 40 hours  a week in front of the monitor, also they work under pressure. Another issue to consider is that after work, they waste their time in the phone cel and maintain their head forward. They suffer from low back pain, neck pain, muscle contractures of the back and a hump.
